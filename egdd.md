- Type the correct word or phrase in enough time to hit back the enemy: Player must type correctly to make the Ninja disappear. For every letter or character typed incorrectly they receive damage on their health bar. 
- If you get hit you lose hit points and if the git points reach 0 you lose: Everytime your character is hit your health bar decreases and once it hits zero you lose the round and have to start over the current level
